FreeCAD 
=======

FreeCAD is a 3D CAD parametric modeling application, whose development is completely *open source*.

FreeCAD contains all kinds of basics moudlues when each module has its ability.
One of the most useable modules is the  *part module* - this module allows you to create 3D parts, start from basics structures such as a cube, cylinder and a sphere, and edit the part as you wish.
Among the modules you can find the *Part Design*, *Mesh Design*, and even a finite Element module *FEM*.

The unique ability of FreeCAD is to use the same data while using different modules. The **Hermes** module has developed to FreeCAD while using that unique ability. 

The Hermes module's purpose is to create input files for CFD runs. It allows you to define the parameters for the run while using parts been created in FreeCAD.  Also, the Hermes module uses the JSON structure in order to save the data been defined.
