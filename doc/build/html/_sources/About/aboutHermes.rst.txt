About Hermes 
============

Hermes is an interface that simplifies the process of defining and running a basic workflow while using differents programs long the way. 

Hermes allows you to define different nodes of the workflow, where you could define the needed data of each node. Also, it allows you to run a process of a node if required.

The interface will be based on input JSON files, which will contain the definition of the workflow and its nodes. The data that have been edit at the interface will be updated on that JSON structure. Also, an output JSON can be defined, so you could stop and continue the work with no loss of data.

The Hermes interface is defined as a module in an open-source parametric modeling application named *FreeCAD*. More information can be found in the FreeCAD section.

The Hermes interface supports the *OpenFOAM* code.
