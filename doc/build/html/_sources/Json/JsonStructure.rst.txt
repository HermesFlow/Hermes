The JSON Structure 
===================

In general, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation ) is a structure saved as a string, which is a lightweight data-interchange format.

The JSON structure is consist of the following types of data:

*    String 
*    Number
*    Array
*    Object
*    Boolean
*    null

The object type consists of key and value pairs. A key name can not repeat itself in the same object.

It is recommended to verify the JSON structure before using it.

Also, the Hermes workflow uses the **react-jsonschema-form**.
This allows a dynamic display, which based on the data been inserted into the JSON structure.
:ref:`The react-jsonschema-form`


The react-jsonschema-form
-------------------------
An input JSON file includes 3 parts:
    
*   **Schema** - define the basic type, name, and structure of the form
*   **uiSchema** - add a display data for the objects been defined at Schema part
*   **formData** - contain the user input of the form

It is recommended to include all 3 parts in the JSON, even if there are empty values.
Each one of those parts is an object, which includes the data been mentioned above.

More information can be found in the `react-jsonschema-form_documentation <https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

Examples for Basic react-jsonschema-form can be found in `live playground  <https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/>`_

**Pay attention**

*    Do not use double apostrophes (") at the formData part - will cause problems because of the JSON structure
*    Avoid using "default" values at the Schema part  -  may create unwanted data at the 'formdata' section,
     better define values directly at the 'formData' section
*    "anyOf"- pay attention not to use the same property name on different list items -> inside the Brackets '[...]',
     even if it is a different object, it will cause problems


Hermes workflow JSON structure
-------------------------------
The Hermes workflow consists of a combination of nodes, each one has its contribution (more information at the Hermes workflow section)
As a result, the JSON of the Hermes workflow must contain the following objects:

*    **nodeList** - Contain a list of all nodes of the workflow
*    **nodes** - contain the data of each node, including :

    *    typeJ - the type of the execution node
    *    typeFC - the type of Freecad node
    *    Input - The input of the executer
    *    properties - properties of the FreeCAD object
    *    webGui - contain the JSON of the "react-jsonschema-form" (Scheme,uiScheme and formData been mention above)
 
In addition, it is optional to add a **Templates** object. This Object will contain repetetive JSON parts,
which will help the user to create some nodes more easily. This ability allows us to add or edit the data after been using the template.

**Import Data**

Because the JSON has lots of data, it can cause to long documents.
Instead, we add the option to create some shorts JSON documents, and they will be called by reference to each other, until creating the whole JSON structure.

The reference can be written as an absolute path or as a relative path to the file

The JSON structure, in this case, is as follow:
    1.    Create an object in the proper place, name it "importJsonFronFile"
    2.    Add to the object the following entries:
        
        *    "path" [string] - the path to the file
        *    "field"[list] (optional) - allows you to take specific data from a file.
             It is saved as a *list* to get multiply fields data from a given file.    

    3.    (optional)Add/Edit the data from the file 
        
        *    write the name of the property and its new value - "property":"new data"
        *    in case of an object - "objectName": { new data }
        *    in case of property nested inside an object - "object":{ "property":"new data" }

    4.    Multiply files - The "importJsonFronFile" will contain an object for each file. their properties will be the same as been mention in (2).
          "importJsonFronFile":{ "file1":{...} , "file2":{...}}

A similar structure applied when using a template from the Template object,    
    1.     Create an object in the proper place, name it "Template"
    2.    Add to the object the following entries:

        *    "TypeFC": the name of the wanted template at the Templates object
        *    "field"[list] (optional) - allows you to take specific data from a file.
             It is saved as a *list* to get multiply fields data from a given file.

    3.    Same as in file import
    4.    Multiply files - The "Template" will contain an object for each file. their properties will be the same as been mention in (2).
          "importJsonFronFile":{ "template1":{...} , "template2":{...}}

* pay attention - it is possible to Add/Edit data from different sources. 

    -    In the case of new data, it will be added to the structure
    -    In case the data already exists, the new data will override the old data.
         It means, the last data been imported, will override any previous data.
