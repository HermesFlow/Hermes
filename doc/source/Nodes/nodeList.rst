Hermes Nodes
============

The nodes in Hermes are divided into types to ease the search for a specific function.

Currently, there are general nodes that execute tasks such as:
* creating files or directories
* copying or moving files or directories
* executing OS command or python script
* creating text files from templates.
* writing the output of a node to a file.

Each node is characterized by its input parameters, the task it performes when executed and its
output parameters.
